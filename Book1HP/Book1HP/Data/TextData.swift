        "Ageyya descended from the Heavens above.\nAgeyya was made of kindness and love.\nShe came here to show us just how to care,\nBy guiding us all in a new way â€” to share.",
        
        "Catoosa descended to fulfill his part\nAfter Ageyya had touched everyone's heart.\nHe says, \"Along with love, goes honor and pride,\nRespect for all people of the Adawee Tribe.\"",
        
        "And this little book will show how it's done.\nA book for all children under the sun.\nAgeyya hopes these stories will be helpful to you.\nCome along with the Tribe and Humility Pew\nWho is this Tribe and Humility Pew?\nAgeyya will now introduce one to you.",
        
        "STORY",
            
        "A meeting was held quite far from Earth.\n\"It's time again for another birth,\"\nSaid the Caregivers to the Spirit above.\n\"Humility Pew will need much love.\"",
        
        "His progress may seem very slow.\nAccomplishments he may not show.\nAnd he'll require extra care.\nFrom the folks he meets down there.",
        
        "He may not run or laugh or play.\nHis thoughts may seem quite far away.\nIn many ways he won't adapt,\nAnd he'll be known as handicapped.",
        
        "So let's be careful where he's sent,\nWe want his life to be content.\n\"Please, Great Spirit, find guardians who\nWill do a special job for you.\"",
        
        "They will not realize right away\nThe leading role they're about to play.\nBut with this child sent from above\nComes stronger faith and richer love.\nThis precious child we describe\nIs one of Galunlati's Adawee Tribe.",
        
        "This Tribe member was once a real stinker,\nA spoiled skunk, not much of a thinker.\nAnd he owned every toy that could possibly be.\nAnd his name back then was simply HP.",
        
        "His room was so cluttered with toys and clothes,\nYou couldn't clean it out with a water hose.\nWhen he tired of a toy, he'd toss it in the air.\nDidn't matter where it landed, he didn't much care.",
        
        "And he treated his friends as mean as could be.\nMade smart remarks, said \"you wish you were me?\"\n\"I don't need you,\" he told everyone.\n\"The best thing of all is me having fun.\"",
        
        " Well, HP's dad was a gambling man.\nSometimes his bets got him into a jam.\nSo he took out a loan on his house for a horse,\nOne that would race and win, of course.",
        
        "But it didn't, and the horse came up lame.\nHis dad lost everything to his name.\nThe beautiful house, and all the things that he had.\nHP watched them go. BOY! Was he mad!",
        
        "\"No toys. No clothes. No car to drive.\nWhy on earth am I still alive?\nI don't want to live like this anymore!\"\n Then he threw a tantrum right there on the floor.\n",
        
        "As time went on, HP couldn't sleep.\nHe wandered about like a little lost sheep.\nHis elegant clothes were now tattered and torn.\nHis shoes were run down, beat up, and worn.",
        
        "That skunk had no scent much less a buck,\nNo question, HP was down on his luck.\nHe hid from his friends, the kids having fun.\nIf they called him to play, how fast he would run!",
        
        "He cried, \"Why! Oh! Why did this happen to me?\nNow what in the world is my life going to be?\nWell, I'll show them!\" And this time he'd go\nTo the woods and a stream, a place no one would know.",
        
        "Then Ageyya appeared and said with a smile,\n\"I think I can help, if you'll listen awhile.\"\nShe came out of the sun, just out of the sky,\nTo touch HP's heart, and his world nearby.",
        
        "\"You want me to listen? I got nothing to lose.\nI got holes in my britches, and holes in my shoes.\"\nAgeyya replied, \"If you want to stand tall,\nHelp someone else when you're feeling small.\"",
        
        "\"Help someone else?\" thought HP,\n\"Somebody else instead of me?\"\nAgeyya continued, \"Look around and you'll find\nThat you can help creatures of every kind.\"",
        
        "For helping others who are doing without,\nMakes you feel good! You'll want to shout!\nYou'll help yourself by helping a friend,\nAnd you will feel better in the end.\"",
        
        "\"Gosh,\" thought HP, as he plodded along,\n\"It just might work, I could've been wrong.\"\nThen Ageyya touched him, not there on his tears,\nShe reached out and touched him, right there on his ears.",
        
        "Suddenly the thunder roared and the lighting flashed!\nThe wind blew the trees and down one crashed!\nAnd a voice from that tree, \"Save my eggs!\" it did scream.\n\"Can you hear? Save my eggs! They'll fall into the stream!\"",
        
        "HP spotted the nest in the tree once high,\nThen looked at the river rushing by.\nThen a limb broke off and down fell the nest\nAnd HP's heart jumped hard in his chest.",
        
        "So quickly he leaped with a neat, clean splash.\nRight into the water like a lightning flash.\nHe swam to the nest with all of his might,\nCaught the sinking eggs, now almost out of sight.",
        
        "His hair covered them over like a little skunkboat,\nAs he swam to the mother like a motorboat.\nAnd about this time, out came the sun\nAnd HP heard a peep, then another one.",
        
        "There in the nest so tiny and small,\nHP saw the most beautiful sight of all.\nSmiles on the beaks of new baby birds,\nFilled his heart with love beyond words.",
        
        "As the tiny birds sang, HP couldn't hide\nThe feeling of joy for saving their lives.\nIn a burst of light The Star Gate came through\nCarrying Ageyya and Catoosa too.",
        
        "\"Spoiled skunk,\" he smiled, \"no longer fits you,\nI give you your new name â€“ Humility Pew.\nWear it with honor and always be true\nto the wonderful person inside of you.\"",
        
        "\"And because you cared and helped someone new,\nSparkle-Magic,\" Ageyya smiled, \"is my special gift to you.\"\nIt's a Higher Power that comes from above.\nIt will shine through your eyes, it's a power called LOVE.\"",
        
        "As the Star Gate rose to its home in the skies,\nThe love she described stayed in Humility's eyes.\nIt was the safest feeling he had ever known,\nThat with love in his heart, he'd be never alone.",
        
        "Never alone? And the Star Gate was gone.\nEven so, her words lingered on.\n\"Never ever forget the pure heart that you gave,\nAs you share of your land of the free and the brave.\"\nIf the stories from the heart really work for you,\nYou'll make a new friend in the Tribe's Book Two.",
        
        "EPILOG",
            
        "I HONOR myself;\nI LIVE by principles that benefit future generations;\nI COMMUNICATE in a peaceful manner;\nI RESPECT all cultures and honor our differences;\nI ACKNOWLEDGE that males and females are equal in their importance;\nI UNDERSTAND what I believe about myself and others creates my world;\nI AM CONNECTED with all creation.",
